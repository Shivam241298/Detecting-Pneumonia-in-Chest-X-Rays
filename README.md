# Detecting-Pneumonia-in-Chest-X-Rays
Developed a deep neural network model to detect pneumonia in Chest X-Rays with a high accuracy.

Physicians often use chest X-rays to quickly detect pneumonia.However,it is much more difficult to make clinical treatments with chest X-rays than with other medical imaging such as CT or MRI. With computer-based diagnosis,physicians can make chest X-ray diagnoses more quickly and accurately.Pneumonia is often detected with chest X-Rays and kills around 50,000 people each year. With computer-aided discovery of pneumonia specifically,physicians can more accurately and efficiently diagnose the disease.In this project, we train a model using the dataset to help physicians in making diagnoses of pneumonia in chest X-Rays.

The dataset used is downloaded from Kaggle

Here,Transfer Learning was used with ResNet50 loaded on pretrained weights and adding few custom layers on it for higher accuracy.
